### Yang Jin's Blog
This is my portfolio, blog, and personal website where I share insights about life, technology, and reading.

👋 Hello! I'm Yang Jin, a front-end engineer based in Shenzhen. I'm excited to share my professional journey and experiences here. Currently, I work on the TikTok Ads Interface team.

After graduating in 2017, I started my front-end development career at HNA. This opportunity allowed me to gradually deepen my understanding of front-end technologies and practices.
In 2018, I relocated from Hainan to Shenzhen, continuing my focus on front-end development. I'm passionate about crafting stable, maintainable web applications with exceptional user experiences.
Now as part of the TikTok Ads team, I specialize in front-end development for advertising products. My daily responsibilities include designing complex component architectures, optimizing performance, and ensuring system stability.

### Outside of Work
I love programming, reading, and sports, including cycling, hiking, badminton, and swimming.
This blog is a place where I record my thoughts and accumulate growth. I hope through writing, I can not only organize my own understanding but also share my experiences and thoughts with more people.
